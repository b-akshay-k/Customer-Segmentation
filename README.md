Problem Statement: Enhancing Supermarket Business Competitiveness through Data Analysis

Background:

Our supermarket has been operating successfully in our small town since 2017, catering to the diverse needs of our customers. However, with the recent entry of a new competitor in the market, it has become imperative for us to analyze our historical data comprehensively. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to improve customer experience, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall business competitiveness.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze various aspects of our supermarket business, including products, employees, customer feedback, purchase patterns, ratings, and promotional activities. Through data-driven insights, we intend to identify areas for improvement, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction, especially for customers who have given low ratings.

Purchase Patterns: Analyze customer purchase behavior, frequency of visits, average transaction amounts, and identify high-value customer segments.
Ratings and Reviews: Investigate low-rated products or services, understand customer grievances, and devise strategies for improvement.
Coupon and Discount Effectiveness: Evaluate the effectiveness of coupons, discounts, and promotional campaigns in attracting customers and driving sales.
Marketing Strategies: Develop targeted marketing campaigns, promotions, and loyalty programs based on customer segments and feedback insights.
Expected Outcomes:

Enhanced employee performance and customer service quality.
Identification of areas for improvement based on customer feedback and ratings.
Effective marketing strategies to attract and retain customers.
